# 254project
The project is to create a program that can be used to select what kind of
thermistor and voltage divider is appropriate for a given temperature range.
Once the user has input relevant data we should plot a temperature vs.
resistance graph to heuristically give an idea of how the circuit will perform.
Ideally we'll be able to generate a lookup table for these values to be used
for coding.

# How to run the program on your own Linux distribution
1. Download and extract all the files in the same folder.
2. Open a terminal inside the folder or open a terminal and move its directory to the folder containg the files. 
3. Copy and paste the following code.
4. sudo apt-get install g++
5. sudo apt-get install make
6. sudo apt-get install qt5-default
7. qmake
8. make
9. ./254
