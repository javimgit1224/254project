# 254project

The project is to create a program that can be used to select what kind of
thermistor and voltage divider is appropriate for a given temperature range.
Once the user has input relevant data we should plot a temperature vs.
resistance graph to heuristically give an idea of how the circuit will perform.
Ideally we'll be able to generate a lookup table for these values to be used
for coding.
